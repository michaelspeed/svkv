						<h2>School Prospectus</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Swami Vivekananda Kendriya Vidyalaya, Moran is providing education based on 
multidisciplinary and creating happy learners.</p><p> 

The school believe that every child is unique in their way and we help them to bring 
inner strength and to nurture the child's potential and develop their intelligence and psychological
power as envisaged by the great thinker and the philosopher-Swami Vivekananda.</p><p>

The school is located in a remote area of Assam where education is not prevailed as it 
should have been. The student comes from lower middle class and poor families and the school is 
trying best to get them in the main stream so that they can compete with the rest of students 
who are from the big towns and cities.

The school gives emphasis on moral values ethics and social skills.</p>
